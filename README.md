# Firewall Implementation for Network Security

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing a **firewall security system** to protect a small business network from unauthorized access and cyber threats. Using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, the project demonstrates firewall configuration, traffic filtering, and network monitoring.

## Installation Instructions
### 1. Required Tools
- **Cisco Packet Tracer** – Network simulation and testing.
- **Firewall (Hardware/Software)** – Security device for traffic filtering.
- **Router & Switches** – Network backbone components.
- **Network Monitoring Tool (e.g., Wireshark)** – For traffic analysis.
- **Packet Filtering Rules** – Defined policies for data flow control.

### 2. Setting Up the Environment
- Download and install **Cisco Packet Tracer** from the **Cisco Networking Academy** website.
- Open the provided **Firewall Implementation** project file in Packet Tracer.
- Familiarize yourself with the **network topology and components**.

## Configuration Steps
### 1. Firewall Setup
- Configure **firewall rules** to block or allow specific traffic.
- Set up **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** to restrict unauthorized access.
- Implement **Network Address Translation (NAT)** for secure internal communication.

### 2. Routing & Security Policies
- Define **static routes** to manage network traffic flow.
- Configure **VLANs** to segment network areas and enhance security.
- Enable **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)** for threat monitoring.

### 3. Network Monitoring & Logging
- Utilize **Wireshark** to analyze network packets.
- Implement **logging mechanisms** for security audits.
- Monitor firewall performance and make necessary adjustments.
